# Why People Are Bad at Technology in 2024 

First of all, I want to start by defining what is technology. Teachnology, in my opinion, provides the necessary abstraction for the users to solve problems effectively and efficiently. By mentioning "problems" here, I want to point out that having problems to solve entails that the problems exist in a space and time. In the past few decades or so, teachnolgy has become so sophisticated and powerful in solving people's problems that most of the people can live comfortably without having too much troubles intheir daily lives. Meanwhile, people's way thinking and most importantly our social structures have not really evolved with the teachnology because the things taught at school and the way people behave within a community remain largely unchanged for the past century. As a consequen. As a consequence, surrounded by the powerful abstractions that are great at solving problems, one can hardly have any geninue problems to solve or attemt to improve the technology if their behaviours and mental model cannot evolve and adapt to the powerful technology around them.
